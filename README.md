This is what use to run the raid bot server back before it was deleted.

most of this code is heavly stolen from Nao parse https://github.com/Iuke121/NaoParse
thanks for the effort you put into that.

all the discord webhooks inside the project are incorrect and broken. please change these to your own.
its likely alot of the opcodes are out of date and broken too.

you need morighan to make this work. one client per ch.

good luck if you plan to use this.
